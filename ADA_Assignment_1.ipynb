        "Nowadays, the real-world data can be found from almost every field and exists with many different types, but the majority of the data is unstructured, messy and disorganized, and this is what the deep learning deal with. \n",
        " \n",
        "Deep learning is a kind of machine learning that used to build and simulate the neural network of the human brain for analysing and learning and to interpret data by imitating the mechanism of the human brain. (Machine learning 2019) Obviously, \"deep learning\" is strongly correlated with \"neural network\" in machine learning, and \"neural network\" is also its main algorithm and means. Otherwise, we can call the \"deep learning\" an \"improved neural network\" algorithm. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Machine learning and deep learning both need a lot of data support and are an application of big data technology. (Irish Tech News 2019) Especially in structured and organised data like images, video, sound or text. It solves the problems with classification, clustering and predictions to get a significant output.\n",
        " \n",
        "In recent years, artificial intelligence(AI) and deep learning have become familiar terms. Generally speaking, deep learning model can be divided into a discriminant model and generative model. Since the invention of Back Propagation, Dropout and other algorithms, the discriminant model has been rapidly developed. However, the development of the generative model was slow due to its difficulty in modelling, so it has a less impact. (Irish Tech News 2019)\n",
        "\n",
        "The generation modelling focuses on how well these neural networks relate data and results through some kind of relationship, for example, Forward propagation networks, convolutional neural networks which is analysing images, recurrent neural networks, RNN which is used to analyse serialized data, such as speech or text, these model let all of the input data to get the desired result. Since the invention of the most successful generative model, the generative adversarial network that gained new vitality to this field. \n",

        "As the generative adversarial network, GAN has been brought up from Ian Goodfellow, it gets more and more attention from the field of academia and industry. (Generative adversarial network 2019) With the rapid development of GAN in theory and model, it has been applied more and more deeply in computer vision, natural language processing, human-computer interaction and other fields, and continues to extend to other fields. This paper proposes a new generation model estimation method to overcome these difficulties.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper propose a new method that does not match the data to the results but use the data to ‘fabricate’ the results, that is, to generate a network. GAN, inspired by the zero-sum game in game theory, regards the generation problem as the confrontation and game between the discriminator and the generator: the generator generates synthetic data from given noise (generally refers to uniform distribution or normal distribution), and the discriminator distinguishes the output and true data of the generator. The generator tries to produce more realistic data and tries to better distinguish the true data from the generated data in the next turns. Thus, the two models make progress in the confrontation and continue against. Then the data obtained from the generative model will be more and more perfect, that is approximating the true data so that the desired data (pictures, sequences, video, etc.) can be generated. The adversarial generation model can take a random set of meaningless number and generate meaningful outputs like paintings, paper bills. The trained generation model will be used for many purposes, for example, edit pictures, images, generic images. \n",
        " \n",
        "The experiment trains two model at the same time, a generative model G as the generator and a discriminative model D as the discriminator, D will estimates the probability of the sample is coming from the training data but not from G, G will maximize the probability of D making a mistake. They are training with backpropagation so they are defined by multi-layer perceptron. The paper also mentions that the Markov chains and the approximate inference are not considered in this experience. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the section of the Adversarial nets and Theoretical Results of the paper, the author methodically mathematically demonstrates the idea and the theory of the adversarial modeling framework, with a optimization function and a set of distribution diagrams. We will discuss it as a innovation method in the next section of this report.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment takes three datasets to train the model: the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST), the Toronto Face Database (TFD) and CIFAR-10 which is a database used to train machine learning and containing multiple sets of images. The rightmost column contains the data generated by the model to the directly adjacent generated samples. This shows us that the adversarial generator does generate, and it is more competitive with the images generated by other generation models, adversarial generation model.\n",

        "\n",
        "At the end of the paper, the author compares the antagonism model with other generation models and then illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of this model, and also with a summary and extension of the results of the whole article.\n",

        "##Innovation \n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of the generative model belongs to probability statistics and machine learning and refers to a series of models used to randomly generate observable prediction data. In short, the \"generated\" sample is as similar as possible to the \"true\" sample. The two main functions of the generative model are to learn a probability distribution and to generate data, which is very important and can be used not only in unsupervised learning but also in supervised learning.\n",
        " \n",
        "This paper introduced a new procedure which is an adversarial model. This procedure is the biggest innovation of the generation adversarial network compared with previous generation models such as an automatic encoder. The adversarial procedure is simply a discriminative model for true or false, which is a dichotomy problem, where you put in a true image and you expect the discriminative model to give you a 1, and you put in a false image and you expect the discriminative model to give you a 0. This has nothing to do with the label of the original picture. No matter how many categories the original picture is, they are all called as true pictures. If the output label is 1, it means that it is true. The label of the generated image is 0, which means false.\n",
        " \n",
        "In the training process, the discriminative model is trained first, and the false data and the true data are input into the discriminant model. At this time, the discriminative model is optimized, hoping that it can correctly judge the true data and the false data, so that a better discriminative model can be obtained.\n",
        " \n",
        "Then we start training the generative model, hoping that the fake data it generates will fool the better discriminative model it has now. The particular way is to distinguish parameters are fixed, the parameters of the generative model were optimized by backpropagation, we expect the generative model with the data after judging device results can be as much as possible close to 1. Then we just need to adjust the loss function, the optimal discriminant apparatus before the loss function is to make the false data as close as possible to zero, and now the trained the generative model loss function is to make the false data as close to 1, so that we could let the generative model generate the expected result. (Hui, J. 2019)\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper used a new method, which is a mathematical distribution to demonstrate how the adversarial model works step by step, to get the results that we expect. \n",

        "In figure (a), the true normal distribution is shown as a dot black lines which represent the true data results we expect to produce. From the state of the points, it is clearly showing a true normal distribution with a clear mean value and its standard deviation. The green solid lines represent the result of a generative model, it will follow the procedure of the adversarial model, to improve its distribution, so that the distribution of the output result will be close to the normal distribution that we expect, which is our true data result. The blue density dotted line generated by the discriminative model, it is used to determine whether the data is from the true normal distribution or the data obtained from the generative model. In Figure (a), the left-hand side of the line describes a result that the data obtained from the generative model is closed to the true normal distribution. On the left side, the line is effect by the generated data, because the value of the generated data here have a large departure from the value of the true normal distribution, so the discriminative model gets a relatively smaller result than the result on the left.\n",
        " \n",
        "In figure (b), we trained the discriminative model first, so that we can let it be more accurate rather than floating up or down. We also remove some noise data.\n",
        " \n",
        "In the figure (c) and (d), we trained the generative model step by step, so that the generated data obtained from the generative model is getting closer and closer to the expected true normal distribution. Finally, we could get the result that is showing from the Figure (d), the result of the discriminative model is almost keeping flat, which means, the generated data is almost identical to the expected normal distribution.

        "In this part, we discuss the quality of the technology developed in this paper. It is divided into two parts: how does the technical development provide and whether the technical support of this paper is convincing\n",

        "First, we discuss the quality of the technical development of this paper. In the part Theoretical Result of the paper, the algorithm is clearly shown, following with two propositions and one theorem. It provides a lot of mathematical languages to work out the established propositions step by step and the optimized formula is derived successfully. Since there are a lot of related works and the process contains a bunch of complex mathematical expressions, it is hard to let the beginners and the ones who don’t know much maths read and understand the proof process. It also mentions how to train the generators and the discriminators simultaneously, neither of which can be overtrained at once to avoid “the Helvetica scenario”.\n",
        " \n",
        "For the theoretical support, the paper used 31 articles as the references, however, it is not that convincing, but still shows the academic nature of this paper. During the experiment, there are three datasets used, MNIST, TFD and CIFAR-10, they were also used in the other experiment for the other generative model, this makes the experiment compelling. Furthermore, there are lots of relevant works that mentioned at the beginning of the paper, for instance, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE), the generative stochastic network (GSN) framework, Deep belief networks (DBNs), and Boltzmann machines (RBMs and DBMs).They could technically support the theorem of the algorithm.\n",

        "The technique of adversarial generation model could be used in many application fields, \n",

        "* The distribution of learning and training data; \n",
        "* When we are faced with a lack of data, we can make up for it by generating models. For example, in semi-supervised learning; \n",
        "* Generate corresponding data according to the needs of the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Creswell et al.2018)\n",
        " \n",
        "Today, GAN's most successful application field is mainly computer vision, including image, video generation, such as image translation, image colouring, image restoration, video generation and so on. Besides, GAN is also slightly expanded and applied in the field of natural language processing and human-computer interaction. \n",
        " \n",
        "For the application in the image restoration, there is a function of photoshop called Content Aware Fill, which is a powerful tool that designers and photographers can use to fill in unwanted or missing parts of an image. When filling in the missing or damaged parts of an image, image completion and repair are two closely related technologies. The adversarial generation model can also be used as a technique to implement content recognition padding, image completion and repair. Also, as the paper mentions, in the end, the research work could toward the application field of the semi-supervised model which has a good ability in the performance of classifiers.\n",
        " \n",
        "Furthermore, this work could be a good discussion in class because this model has both advantages and disadvantages, and it also mentions how to train the generators and the discriminators simultaneously, neither of which can be overtrained at once. And compared to other generation models, for example, the deep directed graphical models or the deep undirected graphical models.\n",

        "##Presentation \n",
        " \n",
        "This paper is an academic report. The logical sequence of this paper is clear and coherent to briefly recommend the generative adversarial model. After introducing the background of the research of generative adversarial model, some related technologies and theories are also mentioned. Then the generation method of the model and the algorithm that expressed in relatively complex mathematical language are introduced in detail. Then, the paper shows how the generative adversarial model working with three databases and makes a brief analysis of the advantages and disadvantages compared with the other generation models. Finally, after summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of the generative adversarial model, there is a simple summary in the end and the future work that needs to be extended.\n",
        " \n",
        "For this paper, I have three suggestions. First, during the explaining steps of the theoretical, it is better to use some basic mathematical expressions, then gradually evolve into complex mathematical equations, to make it easier for readers to understand. Secondly, in the summary section, there is a lack of summary, which could briefly summarize the experimental results. Finally, the whole paper mainly introduces the principle of the model and experimental results, it could recommend some main application of the model and how to cooperate with other application fields.\n",
